  ### Get a locally-issued CNI

  If the local registry office in Poland doesn’t accept UK-issued CNIs, you must make an appointment at the British embassy in Warsaw to get a locally-issued CNI.

  ### Legalisation and translation

  You must check with the local authorities in <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %> to see if your UK-issued CNI needs to be:

  ## What happens next

  If you’re getting married in a registry office, you must give them your CNI at least one month and one day before your wedding. If you’re getting married in a church, you can do this 2 days before the wedding.

  You will be asked to provide a copy of your birth certificate. Make sure you send a [certified copy](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) as you won’t get it back.
