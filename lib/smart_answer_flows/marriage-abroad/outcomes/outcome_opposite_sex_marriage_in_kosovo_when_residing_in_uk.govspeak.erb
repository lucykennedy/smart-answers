<% content_for :body do %>
  Contact the [Embassy of the Republic of Kosovo in London](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

  ^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %>](/foreign-travel-advice/<%= calculator.ceremony_country %>) before making any plans.^

  ##What you need to do

  You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

  <%= render partial: 'legalise_translate_and_check_with_authorities.govspeak.erb',
             locals: { calculator: calculator } %>

  ^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

  %The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

  You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for <%= calculator.country_name_lowercase_prefix %>](/government/publications/<%= calculator.ceremony_country %>-consular-fees).
